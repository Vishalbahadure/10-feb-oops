    "Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode\n",
    "of file opening.\n",
    "In Python, the open() function is used to open a file. It takes two parameters: the file path and the mode in which the file should be opened. There are several modes for opening a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r': Opens a file for reading only. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "'w': Opens a file for writing. If the file already exists, it truncates the file to zero length. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for writing.\n",
    "'a': Opens a file for appending. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for writing.\n",
    "'r+': Opens a file for both reading and writing.\n",
    "'w+': Opens a file for both writing and reading. It truncates the file to zero length if it exists, or creates a new file if it does not exist.\n",
    "'a+': Opens a file for both reading and appending."

    "Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "In Python, the close() function is used to close a file after it has been opened for reading or writing. It is essential to close files to release system resources and ensure that all data is written to the file. Failing to close a file can lead to data loss, memory leaks, or issues with file locking. By closing files properly, you prevent these potential problems and maintain the integrity of your data and system resources. Remember, always close your files using the close() function to adhere to best practices in file handling in Python"
